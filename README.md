# Streamlining-DCF-Project
A lightweight Python backend for fetching, normalizing, and managing financial statement data, designed to serve as the foundation for customizable valuation workflows.

# Overview
The DCF Empower Backend is a lightweight Python service for fetching, normalizing, and managing financial statement data. It is designed to provide a solid foundation for building customizable valuation workflows without prescribing specific forecasting assumptions.

# Vision
Provide analysts with a streamlined data platform that handles the repetitive tasks of data ingestion and normalization, freeing them to focus on the critical judgment and insight that drive accurate valuations.

# Mission
Automate the concrete steps of the DCF process—such as data collection, cleaning, and formatting—while preserving full control over the assumptions and forecasting methodology.

# Goals
* Offer reliable connectors to public financial data sources (for example Alpha Vantage and EDGAR)
* Normalize raw financial statements into a consistent schema
* Enable easy integration of custom forecasting and valuation logic
* Maintain transparency and auditability of every data transformation step

# Iniial Steps
* Define the core data schema for financial statements
* Implement API adapters for initial data sources
* Set up testing and continuous integration
* Build out the normalization and storage layer
